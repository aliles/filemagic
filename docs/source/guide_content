Background
----------

`libmagic <http://www.darwinsys.com/file/>`_ is the library that commonly
supports the *file* command on Unix system, other than Max OSX which has its
own implementation. The library handles the loading of *database* files that
describe the magic numbers used to identify various file types, as well as the
associated mime types. The library also handles character set detections.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

Before installing *filemagic*, the *libmagic* library will need to be
availabile.  To test this is the check for the presence of the *file* command
and/or the *libmagic* man page. ::

    $ which file
    $ man libmagic

On Mac OSX, Apple has implemented their own version of the file command.
However, *libmagic* can be installed using `homebrew
<https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew>`_ ::

    $ brew install libmagic

After *brew* finished installing, the test for the *libmagic* man page should
pass.

Now that the presence of *libmagic* has been confirmed, use `pip
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ to install filemagic. ::

    $ pip install filemagic

The :mod:`magic` module should now be availabe from the Python shell. ::

    >>> import magic

The next section will describe how to use the :class:`magic.Magic` class to
identify file types.

.. _usage:

Usage
-----

The :mod:`magic` module uses `ctypes
<http://docs.python.org/dev/library/ctypes.html>`_ to wrap the primitives from
*libmagic* in the more user friendly :class:`magic.Magic` class. This class
handles initialization, loading databases and the release of resources. ::

    >>> import magic

To ensure that resources are correctly released by :class:`magic.Magic`, it's
necessary to either explicitly call :meth:`~magic.Magic.close` on instances,
or use ``with`` statement. ::

    >>> with magic.Magic as m:
    ...     pass
    ...

:class:`magic.Magic` supports context managers which ensures resources are
correctly released at the end of the ``with`` statements irrespective of any
exceptions.

To identify a file from it's filename, use the
:meth:`~magic.Magic.id_filename()` method. ::

    >>> with magic.Magic as m:
    ...     m.id_filename('setup.py')
    ...
    'Python script, ASCII text executable'

Similarily to identify a file from a string that has already been read, use the
:meth:`~magic.Magic.id_buffer` method. ::

    >>> with magic.Magic as m:
    ...     m.id_buffer('#!/usr/bin/python\n')
    ...
    'Python script, ASCII text executable'

To identify with mime type, rather than a textual description, pass the
:data:`~magic.MAGIC_MIME_TYPE` flag when creating the :class:`magic.Magic`
instance.  ::

    >>> with magic.Magic(flags=magic.MAGIC_MIME_TYPE) as m:
    ...     m.id_filename('setup.py')
    ...
    'text/x-python'

Similarily, :data:`~magic.MAGIC_MIME_ENCODING` can be passed to return the
encoding type. ::

    >>> with magic.Magic(flags=magic.MAGIC_MIME_ENCODING) as m:
    ...     m.id_filename('setup.py')
    ...
    'us-ascii'

.. _unicode:

Unicode and filemagic
---------------------

On both Python2 and Python3, :class:`magic.Magic`'s methods will encode any
unicode objects (the default string type for Python3) to byte strings before
being passed to *libmagic*. On Python3, returned strings will be decoded to
unicode using the default encoding type. The user **should not** be concerned
whether unicode or bytes are passed to :class:`magic.Magic` methods. However,
the user **will** need to be aware that returned strings are always unicode on
Python3 and byte strings on Python2.

Reporting issues
----------------

The source code for *filemagic* is hosted on
`Github <https://github.com/aliles/filemagic>`_.
Problems can be reported using Github's
`issues tracking <https://github.com/aliles/filemagic/issues>`_ system.

*filemagic* has been tested against *libmagic* 5.11. Continuous integration
is provided by `Travis CI <http://travis-ci.org>`_. The current build status
is |build_status|.
